Santa Claus sleeps in his shop up at the North Pole, and can only be wakened by either all nine reindeer being back from their year long vacation on the beaches of some tropical island in the South Pacific, or by some elves who are having some difficulties making the toys. One elfs problem is never serious enough to wake up Santa (Otherwise, he may never get any sleep), so, the elves visits Santa in a group of three. When three elves are having their problems solved, any other elves wishing to visit Santa must wait for those. If Santa wakes up to find three elves waiting at his shops door, along with the last reindeer having come back from the tropics, Santa has decided that the elves can wait until after Christmas, because it is more important to get his sleigh ready as soon as possible. (It is assumed that the reindeer dont want to leave the tropics, and therefor they stay there until the last possible moment. They might not even come back, but since Santa is footing the bill for their year in paradise this could also explain the quickness in their delivering of presents, since the reindeer cant wait to get back to where it is warm.) The penalty for the last reindeer to arrive is that it must get Santa while the others wait in a warming hut before being harnessed to the sleigh.
